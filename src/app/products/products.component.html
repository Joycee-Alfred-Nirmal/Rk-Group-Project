            While both black and white sesame seeds are good for overall health, black
            sesame seeds are particularly beneficial for menstrual health. <br>
            White sesame seeds are also occasionally planted, but black or brown
            sesame seeds are more common in the U.S.2.

        <ng-container *ngIf ="product.title == 'RK Wheat Seeds' " class="exp">
          Planting Time: Fall (before winter). <br>
          Growth Period: Starts growing before winter, slows down during cold
          months, and resumes growth in spring. <br>
          Harvest Time: Late spring or early summer. <br>
          Duration: Approximately 7-9 months from planting to harvest 1.

      <ng-container *ngIf ="product.title == 'AJEYA Groundnut Seeds' " class="exp">
        Certainly! Groundnut, also known as peanut, has a specific growing time period. Let’s
        dive into the details:
         1. Sowing Time:
         o Groundnut is typically sown during the Kharif season (monsoon season)
          in India.
        o For rainfed crops, sow groundnut around 20th June or 10-12 days before
        the onset of monsoon with pre-sowing irrigation. This ensures that
        germination occurs before the rains start, leading to higher yields 1 .
        o In regions with irrigation facilities, you can also sow groundnut after the
        onset of monsoon, usually in the last week of June or the first week of
        July 1 .

        2. Germination and Growth:
        o After planting the seeds, the first flowers typically appear within 4 to 6
        weeks and continue blooming for 6 or more weeks 2 .
        o Groundnuts prefer moderate rainfall during the growing season, ideally
        between 500 mm to 800 mm annually.

    <ng-container *ngIf ="product.title == 'Krishna cotton seeds' " class="exp">
     <span> KRISHNA </span> <br>
      Krishna cotton seeds typically have a growth duration of about 175 to 225 days from
      planting to harvest. <br> Here are some key factors to consider when planting cotton seeds: <br>
      <span>1. Climate and Temperature: </span><br>
      > Cotton thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. <br>
      > The minimum temperature for germination is 15ºC. <br>
      > Optimal vegetative growth occurs between 21 to 27ºC, but cotton can
      tolerate temperatures up to 43ºC. <br> 
      > Warm days and cool nights during the fruiting period promote healthy boll
      and fiber growth. <br>
      <span>2. Soil Conditions: </span><br>
      > Cotton grows well in a variety of soils, including well-drained deep alluvial
      soils in the north (e.g., Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan) and black clayey soils
      in the central and southern regions (e.g., Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
      Tamil Nadu). <br>
      > Avoid excessively salty or wet soils; cotton prefers well-draining soil. <br>
      > Prepare a fertile seedbed free from weeds and other crop plants. <br>
      <span>3. Water Requirements: </span><br>
      > Cotton needs at least 500 mm of water between seed sprouting and boll
      formation. <br>
      > Adequate irrigation is crucial for successful growth.

  <ng-container *ngIf ="product.title == 'RK Maize Seeds' " class="exp">
    MAIZE:
Certainly! Understanding the growth stages of maize is crucial for successful
cultivation. Here are the key growth stages of maize and their approximate time
periods:
1. Emergence:
o Soil temperature of around 10°C is required for germination.
o Seeds take an average of 12-17 days to emerge, depending on soil
temperature 1 .
o At 50°F (10°C), maize takes about 25 days to emerge; at 55-60°F (13-
15°C), it takes 10-14 days; and at 65-70°F (18-21°C), it emerges in 5-8
days 2 .

2. Weaning (4-5 leaf stage):
o Appearance of new roots (crown roots).
o Plant is no longer dependent on seed reserves.
o Sensitivity to nutrient deficiencies, especially phosphorus.
o Final plant density determined.
3. Initiation of Ears (8-10 leaf stage):
o Initiation of ears (number of rows).
o Elongation stage begins at 10 leaves.
o High water and nutrient requirements.
o Sensitive to cold temperatures, low sunlight, and herbicides.
4. Tassel Visible:
o Determines the number of ears per plant.
o 90% of ovules established.
o Sensitive to water and nitrogen availability.
5. Female Flowering:
o Fertilization of ovules by pollen.
o High sensitivity to water deficit.
o High temperatures can disrupt grain development.

  <ng-container *ngIf ="product.title == 'RK Chilli Seeds' " class="exp">
    Use the Right Soil:
o Mirchi plants thrive in well-draining, fertile, and consistently moist soil.
o Create a growing medium by blending equal parts of vermiculture, perlite,
compost, sphagnum peat moss, and sand.
o You can improve soil drainage by adding perlite or grit.
4. Provide the Right Climate and Sunlight:
o Place the pot where it receives 3-5 hours of full sun.
o Chilli plants grow best in warm and humid conditions, with an ideal
temperature range of 22-32°C.
