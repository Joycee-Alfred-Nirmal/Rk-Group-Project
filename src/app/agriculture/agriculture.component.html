          Seeds Packaging
        </span>
      </h1>
      <p>Seeds packaging is the process of preparing seeds for storage, distribution, and sale.</p>
      <h3>Several key functions</h3>
      <p>
        <br><b><u>Protection:</u></b> Seed packaging needs to shield the seeds from various threats like physical damage from bumps or crushing,
        moisture from the environment, exposure to sunlight which can harm germination,
        and infestation by insects, rodents, or diseases.
        <br><b><u>Preservation:</u></b> The packaging should help maintain optimal conditions for seed viability by controlling moisture content and temperature.
        This ensures the seeds remain healthy and have a high germination rate when planted.

        <span *ngIf="showMore">
          <br><b><u>Information:</u></b> Seed packets and labels typically provide important information for gardeners, such as the type of seed, variety, planting instructions, and sowing time.
          This empowers users to make informed decisions about planting and growing.
          <br>
          <b><u>Paper Envelopes:</u></b> <br>
        Paper envelopes are a traditional and widely used method for seed packaging.
         We offer several advantages:
        <br><b><u>Breathability:</u></b>
        With paper envelopes, it becomes easy for seeds to breathe, minimizing the risk of mold and mildew.
     
       The surface of paper envelopes is easy to write on, making it simple to label seed types and planting instructions.
        <br><b><u> Eco-Friendly:</u></b>
       Paper is a biodegradable material, making it an environmentally friendly option.
        
        However, paper envelopes are not as moisture-resistant as other packaging methods, so they may not be suitable for long-term storage in humid conditions. Despite this limitation, paper envelopes remain a popular choice for many gardeners due to their simplicity and eco-friendliness.
